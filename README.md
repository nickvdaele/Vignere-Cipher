# Vignere-Cipher
The task given was to write a C++ program with the capability to encode and decode the Vignere Cipher. The Vignere Cipher is a complex method of encoding text that uses a key, and a lookup table to determine a shift value to apply to each character of a message. To encode a message with the cipher you must sum each character of the message and of the key individually then take the value modulus 26. To decode a message you subtract the characters then add 26 then take that value modulus 26. This solution requires the user to already know the key ahead of time. The purpose of this program is to provide an easy-to-use method of both encoding messages and decoding messages with the Vignere Cipher. My program has a simple-to-understand user interface that can easily be used by anyone, regardless of their level of experience with encryption.
